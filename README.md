## kablamboard

a 36 key "unibody split" column-staggered ergo keyboard

based on the RP2040 zero (because it's cheap)

also there's a rotary encoder

inspired by
[reviung41](https://github.com/gtips/reviung),
[corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd),
[splaytoraid](https://github.com/freya-irl/splaytoraid40),
[cheapino](https://github.com/tompi/cheapino),
that sort of thing

(it's on its own branch)

## kablampad

a 4x3 macropad

my first pcb project

## firmware?

the firmware for all my stuff is in
[my QMK fork](https://github.com/sammy-kablammy/qmk_firmware)

...but it's a little messy over there

sorry
